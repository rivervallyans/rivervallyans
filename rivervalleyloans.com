There are two types of student loansâ€”private and federal. Both serve the same function and are installment loans. The most popular of the two are federal student loans, which generally are available to any student who needs funding and qualifies. There are no minimum credit score requirements to obtain a federal student loan and with the exception of the Direct PLUS loans for parents, graduate students and professional students, there is no credit check involved.
